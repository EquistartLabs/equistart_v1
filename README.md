#### Impact Sector: 
Early Stage Startups

#### Startup Stage:
Prototype of celo testnet-alfajores

## Inspiration:
"Early Stage Startups" find it hectic, expensive and time consuming process to register as a "company" with state authorities at the time.
Traditionally there are no concreate alternative to manage your project equity in a trustless manner, no option to manage finances without trust, and no concrete logs of important decisions.
Facebook or Apple's co-founder spat at the time of scaling can be deemed as an example.

## Solution:
ERC-20 tokens on a public distributed ledger (blockchain) can be created uniquely to symbolise your project Equity. 
This provides a trustless management of distribution with functionalities like on-chain voting for payments, fundraising, or other important decisions.
On chain payment escrow and contract treasury account will help in managing the funds transparently.

## Product:
A simple smart contract framework with the essential to manage the project equity on a public blockchain. 
Any team (including non-tech) can easily create their ERC20 project token through a mobile Dapp.
Stakeholders can back their project token with other widely accepted crypto (like BTC, ETH, CELO, cUSD, USDT), 
transfer their tokens and also log their finances by using the tokens for onchain voting.


### Summary:
Internet unlocked a vast universe of new Applications over the past decades and now blockchain is 
revolutionising how we can manage our financial assetsover the network of computers in a decentralised manner.

This summary explains how we can edge on p[ublic blockchains to create an ERC-20 token representing equity for founders, 
investors and other stakeholders in an Early Stage Startup Project. We aim in creating a generic smart contract template 
which will help "any" startup team to:
- create their project token(ERC20)
- transfer these project tokens(equity)
- manage your finances (escrow, accounts, etc.)
- vote on important decisions.

This Dapp can save hours of time and pile of money while building trust among the team members.
The project can be scaled with the pillars of legal framework to accomodate any startup in the Future or they can choose to migrate
to traditional methods upon necessity. Blockchain projects can use the application till they manage to develop their platform.


### This Repository
**app** folder contains code for react-native application, tested on android devices.

**contract** folder contains the solidity code which is compiled and deployed on alfajores-testnet for now.
